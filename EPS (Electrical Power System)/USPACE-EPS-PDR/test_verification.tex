\subsection{Design Models and Verification Methods}

\subsubsection*{PSpice Simulations}
PSpice transient and average simulation models of the \ac{SAR} will be created. These will help in the design and testing of the regulator performance and system stability during transient loading.

\subsubsection*{Development Model}
A \ac{DM} will be build using self-made "mini-mount" pads and mainly surface-mount components, to minimize parasitic effects. System stability will be tested using a Network Analyzer and MPPT performance will be tested in a \ac{TV} chamber cycling the solar array temperature.

\subsubsection*{Flight Model}
If time allows, a dedicated \ac{FM} will be build, using a custom designed \ac{PCB} schematic layout. An optimized \ac{PCB} layout will minimize the system mass and size while maximizing the efficiency and system robustness.
