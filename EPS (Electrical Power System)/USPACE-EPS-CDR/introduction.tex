The \ac{EPS} provides power to motors, the on-board computer, communication system and payloads. Power is mainly supplied from solar cells but can also be supplied from a battery, when solar power is not available or insufficient. 

\subsection{Changes from PDR to CDR}
\label{sec:changes_pdr_to_cdr}

Table \ref{tab:pdr_to_cdr} lists major design changes from the \ac{EPS} \ac{PDR} report.

\label{tab:pdr_to_cdr}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.25\textwidth}p{0.2\textwidth}p{0.45\textwidth}}
\hline
\textbf{Area of change} & \textbf{Changed parameter } & \textbf{Argumentation for change}\\
\hline
Total power budget & Increased to $>40\,W$ & Airship total mass and size are increased thus requiring much more power for the motors\\
Solar cells & New part & Old solar cell was much heavier than listed in manufacturer datasheet due to a glass cover\\
Total system cost & Increased to $>12000\,SEK$ & Increased power and new light-weight solar cells are more expensive\\
Solar cell mounting & New part & New solar cell is flexible instead of rigid and can be mounted with \ac{PSA}\\
Battery & New part & A battery that supports much higher discharge currents has been selected which simplifies current limiting circuitry and improves battery efficiency\\
