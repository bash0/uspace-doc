Establishment of Viking room to be permanent project course room. 
Quicker release of initial project budget to allow first order of components. 
Access to workshop and help from Lars worked very well.
Generally good support from IRF with borrowing tools and suggestions for mechanical design. If possible, more instructions and recommendations from IRF experts would have been a help (soldering course, how to check solderings under microscope).
More critical design feedback and suggestions from supervisors, where possible, would be appreciated.
More clear initial communication of project course requirement in terms of reports and presentations (how many, which and when).
