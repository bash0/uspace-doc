%\section{Pyrotechnics Interface}

In order to achieve the functionality described in chapter \ref{chap:goals_constraints} there is no need for any form of pyrotechnics. The project does not require the release or deployment of other structures which could make use of pyrotechnics. Therefore pyrotechnics particulars are not discussed in this respect.
