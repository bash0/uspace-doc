\subsection{Functional Organigram}

Based on the expertise of the team members a functional organigram was defined. This structure is shown in figure \ref{fig:obs}.

\subsection{Support Facilities}

The \ac{U-SPACE} project is supported practically, financially and technically by \ac{LTU}. \ac{IRF} and Esrange both provide technical assistance. The practical support from \ac{LTU} consists of the availability of tools and specific rooms (e.g. mechanical workshop or electronics laboratory). Also component orderning (see section \ref{subsec:ordering}) is the responsability of \ac{LTU}. The financial support is discussed in section \ref{sec:financing}.
\\
\\
The technical help of all three support entities consists of guidance regarding the components, support during the fabrication and assistance with the future testing procedures.

\section{Relation With Support Facilities}

\subsection{Reporting and Monitoring}

During the entire project, the team is monitored by Kjell Lundin (\ac{IRF}) and Alf Wikstr√∂m (Esrange). The team and the supervisors have weekly status meetings, in which all current issues are identified, discussed and solved. Reports to the supervisors are discussed in the next subsection.

\subsection{Reviews}

\textit{Will be included in the final version...}

\subsection{Component Ordering}
\label{subsec:ordering}

\ac{LTU} helps the team with the ordering of all components, both national and international. The procedure include component selection by the team, followed by approval of the supervisors and then the final ordering of the components by \ac{LTU}.
