\chapter{Ground Support Equipment}
\label{chap:ground_support}

This chapter describes the required electrical ground support equipment and mechanical ground support equipment for the \ac{U-SPACE} project. 

\section{Electrical Ground Support Equipment (EGSE)}

During flight testing of the \ac{DM}, the following \ac{EGSE} are required: 

\begin{itemize}
\item A power supply to charge the \ac{EPS} batteries before flight.
\item A ground station (depending on the final design of the communication system and requirements for telemetry/telecommand).
\end{itemize}

\textit{More information will be included in the final version...}

\section{Mechanical Ground Support Equipment (MGSE)}

Developing, building and testing the \ac{SPA} will require the following \ac{MGSE}:

\begin{itemize}
\item During flight test a safety system is required to prevent the airship from flying beyond the flight test perimeters in case of failing attitude control. This could be implemented using a simple cable/rope or a similar system.
\item Facilities at test locations for on-site fuelling of the envelope gas, i.e. gas tanks, valves, tubes etc.
\item Storage facility at \ac{IRF}/\ac{LTU} Rymdcampus, for the \ac{SPA} \ac{DM}, components and materials. This storage facility should be large enough to accommodate and transport the large \ac{SPA} structure.
\end{itemize}
