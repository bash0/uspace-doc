\chapter{Mechanical Structure and Envelope}
\label{chap:mse}

General introduction to the subsystem...

\section{Functional and Technical Requirements}

Based on PDR...

\section{Mechanical and Structural Design}

Explain the design including block diagrams, schematics, drawings, etc.

Just a suggestion for the subsections...

\subsection{Cargo Bay}

\subsection{Envelope}

\subsection{Harness}

\subsection{Motor Mounting}

\section{Mechanical Interfaces}

How does the MSE system interact with the other subsystems?

\subsection{Mechanical Interface Control Drawing}

Could not really find what this is and if we need it... Morten?

\subsection{Accommodation Requirements}

Same here...

\section{Physical Properties}

E.g. mass in launch configuration...

\section{Structural and Mechanisms Analysis}

This involves things like dynamic analysis and stress analysis, but as we didn't really do this, just briefly comment on it...

\section{Mounting Attachments}

Not sure what they mean with this... Attachment concept and foot pattern?
