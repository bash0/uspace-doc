\chapter{Test and Verification of Design}
\label{chap:test_verification}

This chapter describes the test procedures of the \ac{U-SPACE} project. Objectives and responsibilities are introduced in section \ref{sec:ver_plan},together with the main test procedures. Section \ref{sec:test_matrices} describes the different test matrices of the subsystems.

\section{Design Verification Plan}

\subsection{Objectives and Responsibilities}

\textit{Will be included in the final version...}
%Why and who?

%\subsection{Verification By Analysis}

%N/A, but comment on it briefly...

\subsection{Verification By Test}

%Write about test procedures...

To test and verify the proposed design concepts throughout the project, four methods are considered \cite{ECSS_verification}, as listed in table \ref{tab:verification_methods}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Design verification methods}
\label{tab:verification_methods}
\begin{tabular}{p{0.3\textwidth}p{0.6\textwidth}}
\hline
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Description}\\
\hline
Testing & Monitoring of system performance and functionality in a simulated test environment.\\[2mm]
Analysis/Simulation & Theoretical calculations and simulations. Also includes verification by similarity, i.e. previously used solution concepts.\\[2mm]
Review of Design & Using records, drawings, schematics, etc. that unambiguously show fulfilment of the system requirements\\[2mm]
Inspection & Visual inspection of hardware/software for good workmanship as well as compliance to industry/design standards\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\noindent
To test the complete \ac{SPA}, a \ac{DM} will be built and subjected to flight testing. A 3-4 week launch campaign is scheduled for the start of autumn. The planned launch site is the old balloon launch site at \ac{IRF} near the \ac{LTU} Rymdcampus or a location at the Esrange Space Center (in cooperation with the \ac{SSC}).

%\subsection{Verification Control System}

%Not sure if this is applicable, but if yes, then the answer should be github I guess...

\section{Subsystem Test Matrices}
\label{sec:test_matrices}

\textit{Will be included in the final version...}

%Different tests presented as a matrix/table: rows are test modules, columns are possible testing techniques. Maybe one per subsystem? Also limited life time elements could be included here...
